# Blood-Group-Detection-using-Fingerprint
Problem Statement
Traditional blood typing methods are often time-consuming and require skilled personnel, limiting their accessibility and efficiency. This study explores an innovative approach utilizing fingerprint image processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate and rapid blood group detection. 

Project Overview
Our proposed system employs advanced image processing algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze fingerprint images, correlating specific patterns with blood group phenotypes. The integration of this method into portable and cost-effective devices can revolutionize point-of-care diagnostics, particularly in resource-limited settings.
